<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Sharjeel Khan, currently a third-year Software Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson). 
My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion for problem-solving and innovation, 
which has driven me to excel in various programming languages and software tools. Through hands-on experience, 
I've developed expertise in Java, Python, C, and various other technologies. My diverse background in usability 
testing at Trymata and tutoring has honed my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively and collaborate within agile frameworks.
</p>

<p>My work is fueled by a deep passion for creating innovative software solutions that enhance user experiences. 
I thrive on the challenge of identifying and addressing usability issues, ensuring that the end products are not only 
functional but also intuitive and accessible. My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my recent enrollment in 
a web development bootcamp, where I'm expanding my skill set to stay abreast of the latest industry trends and technologies.</p>

<p>I am always on the lookout for opportunities to grow professionally and tackle new challenges. Currently, 
I am open to taking on projects that leverage my technical skills and passion for software development.
